      - Creating approach for casual discovery via aligning the latent distributions of data gathered from heterogeneous domains (e.g., tissue samples from different hospitals).
      - Derived method for interpretable optimal transport to explain image-based distribution shifts to a human operator for monitoring ML systems or knowledge discovery [[CVPR publication](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022W/VDU/papers/Kulinski_Towards_Explaining_Image-Based_Distribution_Shifts_CVPRW_2022_paper.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/inouye-lab/explaining-distribution-shifts)].
      - Constructed an interpretable multi-agent reasoning benchmark dataset based on StarCraft II replays yielding 1.8 million game-state windows with multiple data representations such as ones that can be used as a drop-in replacement for CIFAR10 and MNIST. [*accepted to CVPR23*, code and publication link will be released soon]
      - Created a light-weight machine learning algorithm which uses deep density models to detect shifts in distributions as well as determine which feature(s) are causing the shift, allowing for online monitoring with little additional overhead [[NeurIPS publication](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/e2d52448d36918c575fa79d88647ba66-Paper.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/inouye-lab/feature-shift)].

        Worked under Ankur Mallick and Kevin Hsieh to develop novel methods for robust ML inference with streaming data.
        - Creating an efficient model drift mitigation technique for high dimensional streaming data which is compatible with complex realistic shifts such as combinations of covariate drift and concept drift.
        - Deriving method for predicting real-time model degradation in the presence of delayed ground-truth labels.
        - Using this predictive power, we can efficiently retrain models to maximize model uptime while balancing retraining cost

        Worked in M365 Research to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to allow for better search relevance across Microsoft365 applications.  
        - Designed an NLP model that detects if multiple enterprise search queries have the same intent, for the main purpose of measuring the semantic change of a query alteration.  
        - Identified and explored knowledge gap between web search methods (e.g., Google search or Bing search) and enterprise search methods (e.g., Outlook search or Teams search).  
        - Created training pipeline which adapts open web search data to better fit enterprise search training data.

        - Lead the design and development of a novel computer vision model for processing histopathological images for the purpose of cancer detection and downstream diagnosis.  
        - Worked with a team to generate additional cancer related statistics to aid doctors in determining treatment modality.  
        - Developed robust high performance pipeline for continuous analysis of whole slide images for deployment to consumers.

        - Identified issues in state-of-the-art computer vision frameworks for detection of COVID-19
        - Built computer vision models to conquer some of these issues, such as being robust to spatialdistribution shifts. The models were trained using Livermoreâ€™s Sierra HPC system.
        - Used Natural Language Processing techniques on parsed Material Science publications to createan interpretable deep model to aid in the synthesis of new nanostructures and nanomaterials.
