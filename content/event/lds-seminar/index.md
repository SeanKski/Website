title: On Distribution Shifts and What We Can Learn From Them

event: Laboratory of Data Science

location: Virtual

summary: "A talk where I discuss the questions: ''Why are distribution shifts are problematic for ML? How can we live with them? Looking forward, how can we solve this problem?''"
abstract: 'Distribution shifts can have fundamental significance such as signaling a change in the operating environment or substantially reducing the accuracy of downstream models. Thus, understanding distribution shifts is critical for examining and hopefully mitigating the effect of such a shift. This talk hopes to first give deep insights into general distribution shifts and the methods we have developed to help users gain better understandings of specific distribution shift using interpretable transportation maps.  After this, we will look at ways to avoid the problems caused by distribution shifts via methods like domain adaptation or, better yet, domain generalization. Finally, we will take a step back and hypothesize on whether distribution/domain shifts can be seen as “a feature rather than a bug” and whether this viewpoint can lead us to better generalizable machine learning models.'
